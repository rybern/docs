# Pedantic mode

Pedantic mode is a compilation option built into Stanc3 that warns you about potential issues in your Stan program.

For example, consider the following program.

```
data {
  int N;
  real x[N];
}
parameters {
  real sigma;
}
model {
  real mu;
  x ~ normal(mu, sigma);
}
```

When pedantic mode is turned on, the compiler will produce the following warnings.

```
Warning:
  The parameter sigma has no priors.
Warning at 'ped-mode-ex1.stan', line 10, column 14 to column 16:
  The variable mu may not have been assigned a value before its use.
Warning at 'ped-mode-ex1.stan', line 10, column 18 to column 23:
  A normal distribution is given parameter sigma as a scale parameter
  (argument 2), but sigma was not constrained to be strictly positive.
```

Here are the kinds of issues that pedantic mode will find (which are described in more detail in following sections):

-   *Distribution usages issues.* Distribution arguments don't match the distribution specification, or some specific distribution is used in an inadvisable way.
-   *Unused parameter.* A parameter is defined but doesn't contribute to target.
-   *Large or small constant in a distribution.* Very large or very small constants are used as distribution arguments.
-   *Control flow depends on a parameter.* Branching control flow (like if/else) depends on a parameter value.
-   *Parameter has multiple twiddles.* A parameter is on the left-hand side of multiple twiddles.
-   *Parameter has zero or multiple priors.* A parameter has zero or more than one prior distribution.
-   *Variable is used before assignment.* A variable is used before being assigned a value.
-   *Strict or nonsensical parameter bounds.* A parameter is given questionable bounds.

Some important limitations of pedantic mode are listed at the end of this chapter.


## Distribution argument and variate constraint issues

When an argument to a built-in distribution certainly does not match that distribution's specification in the [Stan Functions Reference](https://mc-stan.org/docs/functions-reference/index.html), a warning is thrown. This primarily checks if any distribution argument's bounds at declaration, compile-time value, or subtype at declaration (e.g. `simplex`) is incompatible with the domain of the distribution.

For example, consider the following program.

```
parameters {
  real unb_p;
  real<lower=0> pos_p;
}
model {
  1 ~ poisson(unb_p);
  1 ~ poisson(pos_p);
}
```

The parameter of `poisson` should be strictly positive, but `unb_p` is not constrained to be positive.

Pedantic mode produces the following warning.

```
Warning at 'ex-dist-args.stan', line 6, column 14 to column 19:
  A poisson distribution is given parameter unb_p as a rate parameter
  (argument 1), but unb_p was not constrained to be strictly positive.
```


## Special-case distribution issues

Pedantic mode checks for some specific uses of distributions that may indicate a statistical mistake:


### Uniform distributions

Any use of uniform distribution generates a warning, except when the variate parameter's declared `upper` and `lower` bounds exactly match the uniform distribution bounds. In general, assigning a parameter a uniform distribution can create non-differentiable boundary conditions and is not recommended.

For example, consider the following program.

```
parameters {
  real a;
  real<lower=0, upper=1> b;
}
model {
  a ~ uniform(0, 1);
  b ~ uniform(0, 1);
}
```

`a` is assigned a uniform distribution that doesn't match its constraints.

Pedantic mode produces the following warning.

```
Warning at 'uniform-warn.stan', line 6, column 2 to column 20:
  Parameter a is given a uniform distribution. The uniform distribution is
  not recommended, for two reasons: (a) Except when there are logical or
  physical constraints, it is very unusual for you to be sure that a
  parameter will fall inside a specified range, and (b) The infinite gradient
  induced by a uniform density can cause difficulties for Stan's sampling
  algorithm. As a consequence, we recommend soft constraints rather than hard
  constraints; for example, instead of giving an elasticity parameter a
  uniform(0,1) distribution, try normal(0.5,0.5).
```


### (Inverse-) Gamma distributions

Gamma distributions are sometimes used as an attempt to assign an improper prior to a parameter. Pedantic mode gives a warning when the Gamma arguments indicate that this may be the case.


### lkj\_corr distribution

Any use of the `lkj_corr` distribution generates a warning that suggests using the Cholesky variant instead. See <https://mc-stan.org/docs/functions-reference/lkj-correlation.html> for details.


## Unused parameters

A warning is generated when a parameter is declared but does not have any effect on the program. This is determined by checking whether the value of the `target` variable depends in any way on each of the parameters.

For example, consider the following program.

```
parameters {
  real a;
  real b;
}
model {
  a ~ normal(1, 1);
}
```

`a` participates in the density function but `b` does not.

Pedantic mode produces the following warning.

```
Warning:
  The parameter b was declared but was not used in the density calculation.
```


## Large or small constants in a distribution

When numbers with magnitude less than 0.1 or greater than 10 are used as arguments to a distribution, it indicates that some parameter is not scaled to unit value, so a warning is thrown. See <https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/standardizing-predictors-and-outputs.html> for a discussion of scaling parameters.

For example, consider the following program.

```
parameters {
  real x;
  real y;
}
model {
  x ~ normal(-100, 100);
  y ~ normal(0, 1);
}
```

The constants `-100` and `100` suggest that `x` is not unit scaled.

Pedantic mode produces the following warning.

```
Warning at 'constants-warn.stan', line 6, column 14 to column 17:
  Argument -100 suggests there may be parameters that are not unit scale;
  consider rescaling with a multiplier (see manual section 22.12).
Warning at 'constants-warn.stan', line 6, column 19 to column 22:
  Argument 100 suggests there may be parameters that are not unit scale;
  consider rescaling with a multiplier (see manual section 22.12).
```


## Control flow depends on a parameter

Control flow statements, such as `if`, `for` and `while` should not depend on parameters or functions of parameters to determine their branching conditions. This is likely to introduce a discontinuity into the density function. Pedantic mode generates a warning when any branching condition may depend on a parameter value.

For example, consider the following program.

```
parameters {
  real a;
}
model {
  // x depends on parameter a
  real x = a * a;

  int m;

  // the if-then-else depends on x which depends on a
  if(x > 0) {
    //now m depends on x which depends on a
    m = 1;
  } else {
    m = 2;
  }

  // for loop depends on m -> x -> a
  for (i in 0:m) {
    a ~ normal(i, 1);
  }
}
```

The `if` and `for` statements are control flow that depend (indirectly) on the value of the parameter `m`.

Pedantic mode produces the following warning.

```
Warning at 'param-dep-cf-warn.stan', line 11, column 2 to line 16, column 3:
  A control flow statement depends on parameter(s): a.
Warning at 'param-dep-cf-warn.stan', line 19, column 2 to line 21, column 3:
  A control flow statement depends on parameter(s): a.
```


## Parameters with multiple twiddles

A warning is generated when a parameter is found on the left-hand side of more than one ~ statements (or an equivalent `target +=` conditional density statement). This pattern is not inherently an issue, but it is unusual and may indicate a mistake.

Pedantic mode only searches for repeated statements, it will not for example generate a warning when a ~ statement is executed repeatedly inside of a loop.

For example, consider the following program.

```
data {
  real x;
}
parameters {
  real a;
  real b;
}
model {
  a ~ normal(0, 1);
  a ~ normal(x, 1);

  b ~ normal(1, 1);
}
```

Pedantic mode produces the following warning.

```
Warning at 'multi-twiddle.stan', line 9, column 2 to column 19:
  The parameter a is on the left-hand side of more than one twiddle
  statement.
```


## Parameters with zero or multiple priors

A warning is generated when a parameter appears to have greater than or less than one prior distribution factor.

This analysis depends on a [*factor graph*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_graph) representation of a Stan program. A factor F that depends on a parameter P is called a *prior factor for P* if there is no path in the factor graph from F to any data variable except through P.

One limitation of this approach is that the compiler cannot distinguish between *modeled* `data` variables and other convenient uses of `data` variables such as data sizes or hyperparameters. This warning assumes that all data variables (except for `int` variables) are modeled data, which may cause extra warnings.

For example, consider the following program.

```
data {
  real x;
}
parameters {
  real a;
  real b;
  real c;
  real d;
}
model
{
  a ~ normal(0, 1); // this is a prior
  x ~ normal(a, 1); // this is not a prior, since data is involved

  b ~ normal(x, 1); // this is also not a prior, since data is involved

  // this is not a prior for c, since data is involved through b
  // but it is a prior for b, since the data is only involved through b
  c ~ normal(b, 1);

  //these are multiple priors:
  d ~ normal(0, 1);
  1 ~ normal(d, 1);
}
```

One prior is found for `a` and for `b`, while `c` only has a factor that touches a `data` variable and `d` has multiple priors.

Pedantic mode produces the following warning.

```
Warning:
  The parameter c has no priors.
Warning:
  The parameter d has 2 priors.
```


## Variables used before assignment

A warning is generated when any variable is used before it has been assigned a value.

For example, consider the following program.

```
transformed data {
  real x;
  if (1 > 2)
    x = 1;
  else
    print("oops");
  print(x);
}
```

Since `x` is only assigned in one of the branches of the `if` statement, it might get to `print(x)` without having been assigned to.

Pedantic mode produces the following warning.

```
Warning at 'uninit-warn.stan', line 7, column 8 to column 9:
  The variable x may not have been assigned a value before its use.
```


## Strict or nonsensical parameter bounds

Except when there are logical or physical constraints, it is very unusual for you to be sure that a parameter will fall inside a specified range. A warning is generated for all parameters declared with the bounds `<lower=.., upper=..>` except for `<lower=0, upper=1>` or `<lower=-1, upper=1>`.

In addition, a warning is generated when a parameter bound is found to have `lower >= upper`.

For example, consider the following program.

```
parameters {
  real<lower=0, upper=1> a;
  real<lower=-1, upper=1> b;
  real<lower=-2, upper=1012> c;
}
model {
  c ~ normal(b, a);
}
```

Pedantic mode produces the following warning.

```
Warning:
  Your Stan program has a parameter c with a lower and upper bound in its
  declaration. These hard constraints are not recommended, for two reasons:
  (a) Except when there are logical or physical constraints, it is very
  unusual for you to be sure that a parameter will fall inside a specified
  range, and (b) The infinite gradient induced by a hard constraint can cause
  difficulties for Stan's sampling algorithm. As a consequence, we recommend
  soft constraints rather than hard constraints; for example, instead of
  constraining an elasticity parameter to fall between 0, and 1, leave it
  unconstrained and give it a normal(0.5,0.5) prior distribution.
```


## Pedantic mode limitations


#### Constant values are sometimes uncomputable

Pedantic mode attempts to evaluate expressions down to literal values so that they can be used to generate warnings. For example, in the code `normal(x, 1 - 2)`, the expression `1 - 2` will be evaluated to `-1`, which is not a valid variance argument so a warning is generated. However, this strategy is limited; it is often impossible to fully evaluate expressions in finite time.


#### Container types

Currently, indexed variables are not handled intelligently, so they are treated as monolithic variables. Each analysis treats indexed variables conservatively (erring toward generating fewer warnings).


#### Data variables

The declaration information for `data` variables is currently not considered, so using `data` as incompatible arguments to distributions may not generate the appropriate warnings.


#### Control flow dependent on parameters in nested functions

If a parameter is passed as an argument to a user-defined function within another user-defined function, and then some control flow depends on that argument, the appropriate warning will not be thrown.
