# Variational Inference

CmdStan can approximate the posterior distribution using variational
inference.  The approximation is a Gaussian in the unconstrained variable space.
Stan implements two variational algorithms. The `algorithm=meanfield` option
uses a fully factorized Gaussian for the approximation.
The `algorithm=fullrank` option uses a Gaussian with a full-rank
covariance matrix for the approximation.

The executable does not need to be recompiled in order to
switch to variational inference, and the data input format is the
same. The following is a minimal call to Stan's variational inference
algorithm using defaults for everything but the location of the data
file.

```
> ./bernoulli variational data file=bernoulli.data.R
```

Executing this command prints both output to the console and
to a csv file.

The first part of the console output reports on the configuration used.
Here it indicates the default mean-field setting of the variational
inference algorithm. It also indicates the default parameter sizes and
tolerances for monitoring the algorithm's convergence.
```
method = variational
  variational
    algorithm = meanfield (Default)
      meanfield
    iter = 10000 (Default)
    grad_samples = 1 (Default)
    elbo_samples = 100 (Default)
    eta = 1 (Default)
    adapt
      engaged = 1 (Default)
      iter = 50 (Default)
    tol_rel_obj = 0.01 (Default)
    eval_elbo = 100 (Default)
    output_samples = 1000 (Default)
id = 0 (Default)
data
  file = bernoulli.data.json
init = 2 (Default)
random
  seed = 3323783840 (Default)
output
  file = output.csv (Default)
  diagnostic_file =  (Default)
  refresh = 100 (Default)
```
After the configuration has been displayed, informational and
timing messages are output:
```
------------------------------------------------------------
EXPERIMENTAL ALGORITHM:
  This procedure has not been thoroughly tested and may be unstable
  or buggy. The interface is subject to change.
------------------------------------------------------------

Gradient evaluation took 2.1e-05 seconds
1000 transitions using 10 leapfrog steps per transition would take 0.21 seconds.
Adjust your expectations accordingly!
```
The rest of the output describes the progression of the algorithm.
An adaptation phase finds a good value for the step size scaling
parameter `eta`. The evidence lower bound (ELBO) is the variational
objective function and is evaluated based on a Monte Carlo estimate.
The variational inference algorithm in Stan is stochastic, which makes
it challenging to assess convergence. That is, while the algorithm
appears to have converged in $\sim$ 250 iterations, the algorithm runs
for another few thousand iterations until mean change in ELBO drops
below the default tolerance of 0.01.
```
Begin eta adaptation.
Iteration:   1 / 250 [  0%]  (Adaptation)
Iteration:  50 / 250 [ 20%]  (Adaptation)
Iteration: 100 / 250 [ 40%]  (Adaptation)
Iteration: 150 / 250 [ 60%]  (Adaptation)
Iteration: 200 / 250 [ 80%]  (Adaptation)
Success! Found best value [eta = 1] earlier than expected.

The output from variational is written into the file `output.csv`
by default. The output follows the same pattern as the output for
sampling, first dumping the entire set of parameters used
as CSV comments:
```
# stan_version_major = 2
# stan_version_minor = 23
# stan_version_patch = 0
# model = bernoulli_model
# method = variational
#   variational
#     algorithm = meanfield (Default)
#       meanfield
#     iter = 10000 (Default)
#     grad_samples = 1 (Default)
#     elbo_samples = 100 (Default)
#     eta = 1 (Default)
#     adapt
#       engaged = 1 (Default)
#       iter = 50 (Default)
#     tol_rel_obj = 0.01 (Default)
#     eval_elbo = 100 (Default)
#     output_samples = 1000 (Default)
...
```

Next is the column header line, followed more CSV comments reporting the
adapted value for the stepsize, followed by the values.
The first line is special: it is the mean of the variational approximation.
The rest of the output contains `output_samples` number of samples
drawn from the variational approximation.

```

```
The header indicates the unnormalized log probability with `lp__`.
This is a legacy feature that we do not use for variational inference.
The ELBO is not stored unless a diagnostic option is given.
