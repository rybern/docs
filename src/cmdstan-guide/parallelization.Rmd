# Parallelization {#parallelization}

Stan provides [high-level parallelization](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/parallelization-chapter.html)
via multi-threading by use of the `reduce_sum` and `map_rect` functions in a Stan program.
Stan also provides [low-level parallelization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.01063.pdf)
on GPU hardware using the [OpenCL](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/) framework to speed
up matrix operations.
Both of these features require building executibles which call the appropriate
libraries.  This is done via [makefile variables](#gnu-make) which set the appropriate
C++ compiler and linker flags:

- `STAN_THREADS` - compiler directives for threading
- `STAN_OPENCL` - compiler directives for GPU-aware matrix operations

These options can be combined, it is possible to run a program which uses multi-threading
operations on a machine with GPU hardware, in which case, the call to Make 

For example to compile program `parallel_logistic.stan` which uses
[`reduce_sum`](https://mc-stan.org/docs/stan-users-guide/reduce-sum.html) for within-chain
parallelization on an OpenCL (GPU) machine:

```
> make STAN_THREADS=TRUE STAN_OPENCL=TRUE /path/to/parallel_logistic
```

In addition, for multi-threaded programs, it is necessary to specify the number of available threads
via the shell environment variable `STAN_NUM_THREADS` which specifies how many threads to run in parallel.
Generally, this number should not exceed the number of available cores.
If this variable isn't set, then the program will run single-threaded.
To run a single chain on a 4-core machine for program `parallel_logistic`:

```
export STAN_NUM_THREADS=4
./parallel_logistic sample data file=data.csv ...
```
