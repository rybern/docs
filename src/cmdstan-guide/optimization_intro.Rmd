# Optimization

The CmdStan executable can run Stanâ€™s optimization algorithms
for penalized maximum likelihood estimation which provide a
deterministic method to find the posterior mode.
If the posterior is not convex, there is no guarantee Stan
will be able to find the global mode as opposed to a local optimum
of log probability.

The executable does not need to be
recompiled in order to switch from sampling to optimization, and the
data input format is the same.
The following is a minimal call to
Stan's optimizer using defaults for everything but the location of the
data file.

```
> ./bernoulli optimize data file=bernoulli.data.json
```

Executing this command prints both output to the console and
to a csv file.

The first part of the console output reports on the configuration used.
The above command uses all default configurations, therefore the optimizer
used is the L-BFGS optimizer and its default initial stepsize and
tolerances for monitoring convergence:
```
 ./bernoulli optimize data file=bernoulli.data.json
method = optimize
  optimize
    algorithm = lbfgs (Default)
      lbfgs
        init_alpha = 0.001 (Default)
        tol_obj = 1e-12 (Default)
        tol_rel_obj = 10000 (Default)
        tol_grad = 1e-08 (Default)
        tol_rel_grad = 10000000 (Default)
        tol_param = 1e-08 (Default)
        history_size = 5 (Default)
    iter = 2000 (Default)
    save_iterations = 0 (Default)
id = 0 (Default)
data
  file = bernoulli.data.json
init = 2 (Default)
random
  seed = 87122538 (Default)
output
  file = output.csv (Default)
  diagnostic_file =  (Default)
  refresh = 100 (Default)
```

The second part of the
output indicates how well the algorithm fared, here converging and
terminating normally. The numbers reported indicate that it took 5
iterations and 8 gradient evaluations.
This is, not surprisingly, far fewer iterations than required
for sampling; even fewer iterations would be used with less stringent
user-specified convergence tolerances.
The `alpha` value is for step size used. 
In the final state the change in parameters was roughly $0.002$
and the length of the gradient roughly 3e-05 ($0.00003$).

```
Initial log joint probability = -6.85653
    Iter      log prob        ||dx||      ||grad||       alpha      alpha0  # evals  Notes 
       5      -5.00402    0.00184936   3.35074e-05           1           1        8   
Optimization terminated normally: 
  Convergence detected: relative gradient magnitude is below tolerance
```

The output from optimization is written into the file
`output.csv` by default. The output follows the same pattern as
the output for sampling, first dumping the entire set of parameters
used as comment lines:

```
# stan_version_major = 2
# stan_version_minor = 23
# stan_version_patch = 0
# model = bernoulli_model
# method = optimize
#   optimize
#     algorithm = lbfgs (Default)
...
```

Following the config information, are two lines of output:
the CSV headers and the recorded values:

```
lp__,theta
-5.00402,0.200003
```

Note that everything is a comment other than a line for the header,
and a line for the values. Here, the header indicates the unnormalized
log probability with `lp__` and the model parameter
`theta`. The maximum log probability is -5.0 and the posterior
mode for `theta` is 0.20. The mode exactly matches what we would
expect from the data.^[The Jacobian adjustment included for the sampler's log
probability function is not applied during optimization, because it
can  change the shape of the posterior and hence the solution.]

Because the prior was uniform, the result 0.20 represents the maximum
likelihood estimate (MLE) for the very simple Bernoulli model. Note
that no uncertainty is reported.

All of the optimizers stream per-iteration intermediate approximations to the command line console.
The sub-argument `save_iterations` specifies whether or not to save
the intermediate iterations to the output file.
Allowed values are $0$ or $1$, corresponding to `False` and `True` respectively.
The default value is $0$, i.e., intermediate iterations are not saved to the output file.
Running the optimizer with `save_iterations=1` writes both
the initial log joint probability and values for all iterations to the output CSV file.

Running the example model with option `save_iterations=1`, i.e., the command
```
> ./bernoulli optimize save_iterations=1 data file=bernoulli.data.json
```
produces CSV file output rows:
```
lp__,theta
-6.85653,0.493689
-6.10128,0.420936
-5.02953,0.22956
-5.00517,0.206107
-5.00403,0.200299
-5.00402,0.200003
```
