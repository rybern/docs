# `stanc`: Translating Stan to C++ {#stanc}

CmdStan translates Stan programs to C++ using the Stan compiler
program which is included in the CmdStan release `bin` directory as
program `stanc`.

As of release 2.22, the CmdStan Stan to C++ compiler is written in
OCaml. This compiler is called "stanc3" and has has its own
repository https://github.com/stan-dev/stanc3, from which pre-built
binaries for Linux, Mac, and Windows can be downloaded.

Prior to release 2.22, the Stan compiler program was compiled from C++
source code that was part of the core Stan library. This C++ compiler
is still available as program `bin/stanc2`. This compiler is no
longer being maintained, i.e., existing bugs will not be fixed and new
functions and features are only available in the stanc3 compiler. Its
intended use is as a diagnostic tool and backup for the new stanc3 compiler.
For some future version, it will be dropped from the release altogether.

## Instantiating the `stanc` Binary

Before the Stan compiler can be used, the binary stanc must be
created. This can be done using the makefile as follows. For Mac and
Linux:
```
make bin/stanc
```
For Windows:
```
make bin/stanc.exe
```
To build the `bin/stanc2` program, specify:
```
make bin/stanc2
```

## The Stan Compiler Program

The Stan compiler program `stanc` converts Stan programs to C++ concepts.
If the compiler encounters syntax errors in the program,
it will provide an error message indicating the location
in the input where the failure occurred and reason for the failure.
The following example illustrates a fully qualified call to stanc to
generate the C++ translation of the example model `bernoulli.stan`.
For Linux and Mac:
```
> cd <cmdstan-home>
> bin/stanc --o=bernoulli.hpp examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.stan
```
For Windows:
```
> cd <cmdstan-home>
> bin/stanc.exe --o=bernoulli.hpp examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.stan
```

The base name of the Stan program file determines the name of the C++ model class.
Because this name is the name of a C++ class, it must
start with an alphabetic character (`a--z` or `A--Z`) and
contain only alphanumeric characters (`a--z`, `A--Z`, and
`0--9`) and underscores (`_`) and should not conflict with
any C++ reserved keyword.

The C++ code implementing the class is written to the file
`bernoulli.hpp` in the current directory. The final argument,
`bernoulli.stan`, is the file from which to read the Stan
program.

In practice, stanc is invoked indirectly, via the GNU Make utility,
which contains rules that compile a Stan program to its corresponding
executable. To build the simple Bernoulli model via `make`, we specify
the name of the target executable file.
On Mac and Linux, this is the name of the Stan program with the `.stan`
omitted. On Windows, replace `.stan` with `.exe`, and make
sure that the path is given with slashes and not backslashes.
For Linux and Mac:
```
> make examples/bernoulli/bernoulli
```
For Windows:
```
> make examples/bernoulli/bernoulli.exe
```

The makefile rules first invoke the stanc compiler to translate the
Stan model to C++ , then compiles and links the C++ code to a binary
executable. The makefile variable `STANCFLAGS` can be used to to
override the default arguments to stanc, e.g.,
```
> make STANCFLAGS="--include-paths=~/foo" examples/bernoulli/bernoulli
```
To use the stanc2 compiler instead of the stanc3 compiler, set the
make option `STANC2`:
```
> make STANC2=TRUE examples/bernoulli/bernoulli
```

## Command-Line Options for stanc3

The stanc3 compiler has the following command-line syntax:

```
> stanc (options) <model_file>
```
where `<model_file>` is a path to a Stan model
file ending in suffix `.stan`.

The stanc3 options are:

- `--help` - Displays the complete list of stanc3 options, then exits.

- `--version` - Display stanc version number

- `--name=<model_name>` - Specify the name of the class
used for the implementation of the Stan model in the generated C++ code.

- `--o=<file_name>` -  Specify the name of the file into
which the generated C++ is written.

- `--allow-undefined` - Do not throw a parser error
if there is a function in the Stan program
that is declared but not defined in the functions block.

- `--include_paths=<dir1,...dirN>` - Takes a comma-separated list
of directories that may contain a file in an `#include` directive.

- `--use-opencl` - If set, will use additional Stan OpenCL
features enabled in the Stan-to-C++ compiler.

- `--auto-format` - Pretty prints the program to the console.

- `--print-canonical` - Prints the canonicalized program to the console.

- `--print-cpp` - If set, output the generated C++ Stan model class to stdout.

- `--O` - Allow the compiler to apply all optimizations to the Stan
code. **WARNING:** _This is currently an experimental feature!_

- `--warn-uninitialized` - Emit warnings about uninitialized variables
to stderr. Currently an experimental feature.


The compiler also provides a number of debug options which are
primarily of interest to stanc3 developers; use the `--help`
option to see the full set.

## Command-Line Options for stanc2

The stanc2 compiler has the same command-line syntax as the
stanc3 compiler, but has fewer options:

- `--help` - Displays the complete list of stanc3 options, then exits.

- `--version` - Display stanc version number

- `--name=<model_name>` - Specify the name of the class
used for the implementation of the Stan model in the generated C++ code.

- `--o=<file_name>` -  Specify the name of the file into
which the generated C++ is written.

- `--allow_undefined` - Do not throw a parser error
if there is a function in the Stan program
that is declared but not defined in the functions block.

- `--include_paths=<dir1,...dirN>` - Takes a comma-separated list
of directories that may contain a file in an `#include` directive.

## Using External C++ Code

The `--allow_undefined` flag can be passed to the call to stanc,
which will allow undefined functions in the Stan language to be parsed
without an error. We can then include a definition of the function in
a C++ header file.
This requires specifying two makefile variables:
- `STANCFLAGS=--allow_undedefined`
- `USER_HEADER=<header_file.hpp>`, where `<header_file.hpp>` is the name of a header file that
defines a function with the same name and signature in a namespace
that is formed by concatenating the `class_name` argument to
stanc documented above to the string `_namespace` 


As an example, consider the following variant of the Bernoulli example

```
functions {
       real make_odds(real theta);
}
data {
       int<lower=0> N;
       int<lower=0,upper=1> y[N];
     }
     parameters {
       real<lower=0,upper=1> theta;
}
model {
       theta ~ beta(1,1);  // uniform prior on interval 0,1
       y ~ bernoulli(theta);
     }
     generated quantities {
       real odds;
       odds = make_odds(theta);
}
```
Here the `make_odds` function is declared but not defined, which
would ordinarily result in a parser error. However, if you put
`STANCFLAGS = --allow_undefined` into the `make/local` file
or into the `stanc` call, then the stanc compiler will translate
this program to C++, but the generated C++ code will not compile
unless you write a file
such as `examples/bernoulli/make_odds.hpp` with the following lines
```
namespace bernoulli_model_namespace {
          template <typename T0__>  inline  typename
          boost::math::tools::promote_args<T0__>::type  make_odds(const T0__&
theta, std::ostream* pstream__) {
       return theta / (1 - theta);  }
       }
```
Given the above, the following `make` invocation should work
```
> make STANCFLAGS=--allow_undefined USER_HEADER=examples/bernoulli/make_odds.hpp examples/bernoulli/bernoulli # on Windows add .exe
```
Alternatively, you could put `STANCFLAGS` and `USER_HEADER` into the
`make/local` file instead of specifying them on the command-line.

If the function were more complicated and involved functions in the
Stan Math Library, then you would need to prefix the function calls
with `stan::math::`  The `pstream__` argument is mandatory
in the signature but need not be used if your function does not print
any output. To see the necessary boilerplate look at the corresponding
lines in the generated C++ file.
